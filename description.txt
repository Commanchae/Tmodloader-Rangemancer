P.S. Thanks for the support, everyone!

[Currently starting to develop hardmode weapons.]
(I will still keep 1.4.3 updated, at least until the main content is finished or 1.4.4 becomes stable)
v1.1.0.0:
- Added daedalus stormbow summon.
- Introduced penalty mechanic where ranged summons of the same item will have a slight damage penalty (0.95 multiplier for each summon of the same item)

Description

Summon an arsenal of ranged weapons!
Have you ever thought about how awesome it would be if you could summon your beloved bows or guns as minions? Or ever struggled to decide between going for a Ranged or a Summoner class...or both?

This is all possible with Rangemancer.

With Rangemancer, you have the ability to enchant certain ranged weapons, coverting them to their summoning counterpart, allowing you to summon them to fight alongside you.

Main features
1. You can convert certain bows and guns to their summoning counterparts.
2. The weapons will consume the ammo in your inventory. (Bows that have special effects from using wooden arrows will retain their effects (some effects may not work correctly for now))
3. Holding the respective summon item will allow that ranged weapon to use its special ability after a specific number of shots.
4. Damage penalty for subsequent summons of the same item (Thanks Hiya Papaya!). Ex. If you summon 1 wooden bow and 1 platinum bow, they will both have 100% of their original damage. But if you suummon 2 wooden bows, the first one will have 100% of their original damage, the second would have 95%. Each subsequent summon would be 95% of the previous summon.


There are currently 20 weapons (17 pre-hardmode, 3 hardmode) available:

Bows
1. Enchanted Wooden Bow (1 x Wooden Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
2. Enchanted Gold Bow (1 x Gold Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
3. Enchanted Tendon Bow (1 x Tendon Bow / Demon Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
4. Enchanted Bee's Knees (1 x The Bee's Knees + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
5. Enchanted Molten Fury (1 x Molten Fury + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
6. Enchanted Boreal Bow (1 x Boreal Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
7. Enchanted Demon Bow (1 x Demon Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
8. Enchanted Platinum Bow (1 x Platinum Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
9. Enchanted Daedalus Stormbow

4. Enchanted Boomstick (1 x Boomstick + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
5. Enchanted Snowball Cannon (1 x Snowball Cannon + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
6. Enchanted Undertaker (1 x The Undertaker + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
7. Enchanted Blowpipe (1 x Blowpipe + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
8. Enchanted Clockwork Assault Rifle (1 x Clockwork Assault Rifle + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
9. Enchanted Onyx Blaster (1 x Onyx Blaster+ 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)

Miscellaneous

2. Enchanted Shuriken (1 x Shuriken + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) (Consumes shurikens (35% consumption rate))

Notes
1. This mod is a simply a passion project. I'll only work on it when I can.
2. I have not tested this with other mods, therefore I won't be able to guarantee mod compatibility.
3. The ammo only interacts correctly with the Endless Quiver/MusketPouch and not accessories like Magic Quiver, etc.

Known Bugs
- A bug currently exists where bows may randomly disappear.

Plans for Next Update:
- Either continue creating hardmode weapons or start porting to 1.4.4.
- More exclusive abilities for other weapons.

Future Plans
1. More weapons.
2. Potentially other types of weapons (magic).
3. More unique abilities.


Important: Feedback will be greatly appreciated, but please be nice :3
Please kindly report any bugs as well!
