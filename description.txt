[h2] Description [/h2]

Summon an arsenal of ranged weapons!
Have you ever thought about how awesome it would be if you could summon your beloved bows or guns as minions? Or ever struggled to decide between going for a Ranged or a Summoner class...or both?

This is all possible with Rangemancer.

With Rangemancer, you have the ability to convert certain ranged weapons to their summoning counterpart, allowing you to summon them to fight alongside you.

[h2] Main Features [/h2]
1. You can convert certain bows and guns to their summoning counterparts.
2. The weapons will consume the ammo in your inventory. (Bows that have special effects from using wooden arrows will retain their effects (some effects may not work correctly for now))
3. Holding the respective summon item will allow that ranged weapon to use its special ability after a specific number of shots.
4. Damage penalty for subsequent summons of the same item (Thanks Hiya Papaya!). Ex. If you summon 1 wooden bow and 1 platinum bow, they will both have 100% of their original damage. But if you summon 2 wooden bows, the first one will have 100% of their original damage, the second would have 95%. Each subsequent summon would be 95% of the previous summon.


There are currently 36 weapons available:

[h2] Notes [/h2]
1. This mod is a simply a passion project. I'll only work on it when I can.
2. I have not tested this with other mods, therefore I won't be able to guarantee mod compatibility.
3. The ammo only interacts correctly with the Endless Quiver/MusketPouch and not accessories like Magic Quiver, etc.
4. I have not tested this with multiplayer, won't be able to guarantee compatibility at the moment.

[h2] Known Bugs [/h2]
- A bug currently exists where summons may randomly disappear.

[h2] To be implemented: [/h2]
- Enchanted Vortex Beater
- Enchanted Phantasm
- Damage nerf.
- More planned.


[h2] Important: Feedback will be greatly appreciated, but please be nice :3 [/h2]
