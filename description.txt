Latest Update: Ported to 1.4.4!
v1.0.0.0:
- Ported to 1.4.4, bugs are expected! Please be nice in reporting the bugs :3

[h2] Description [/h2]

Summon an arsenal of ranged weapons!
Have you ever thought about how awesome it would be if you could summon your beloved bows or guns as minions? Or ever struggled to decide between going for a Ranged or a Summoner class...or both?

This is all possible with Rangemancer.

With Rangemancer, you have the ability to enchant certain ranged weapons, coverting them to their summoning counterpart, allowing you to summon them to fight alongside you.

[h2] Main features [/h2]
1. You can convert certain bows and guns to their summoning counterparts.
2. The weapons will consume the ammo in your inventory. (Bows that have special effects from using wooden arrows will retain their effects (some effects may not work correctly for now))
3. Holding the respective summon item will allow that ranged weapon to use its special ability after a specific number of shots.

There are currently 19 weapons (17 pre-hardmode, 2 hardmode) available:

[h3] Bows [/h3]
1. Enchanted Wooden Bow (1 x Wooden Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
2. Enchanted Gold Bow (1 x Gold Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
3. Enchanted Tendon Bow (1 x Tendon Bow / Demon Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
4. Enchanted Bee's Knees (1 x The Bee's Knees + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
5. Enchanted Molten Fury (1 x Molten Fury + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
6. Enchanted Boreal Bow (1 x Boreal Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
7. Enchanted Demon Bow (1 x Demon Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
8. Enchanted Platinum Bow (1 x Platinum Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)

[h3] Guns [/h3]
1. Enchanted Flintlock Pistol (1 x Flintlock Pistol + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) 
2. Enchanted Minishark (1 x Minishark + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) 
3. Enchanted Musket (1 x Musket + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) 
4. Enchanted Boomstick (1 x Boomstick + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
5. Enchanted Snowball Cannon (1 x Snowball Cannon + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
6. Enchanted Undertaker (1 x The Undertaker + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
7. Enchanted Blowpipe (1 x Blowpipe + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
8. Enchanted Clockwork Assault Rifle (1 x Clockwork Assault Rifle + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
9. Enchanted Onyx Blaster (1 x Onyx Blaster+ 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)

 [h3] Miscellaneous [/h3]
1. Enchanted Grenade (1 x Grenade + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) (Consumes grenades (50% consumption rate))
2. Enchanted Shuriken (1 x Shuriken + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) (Consumes shurikens (35% consumption rate))

[h2] Notes [/h2]
1. This mod is a simply a passion project. I'll only work on it when I can.
2. I have not tested this with other mods, therefore I won't be able to guarantee mod compatibility.
3. The ammo only interacts correctly with the Endless Quiver/MusketPouch and not accessories like Magic Quiver, etc.

[h2] Known Bugs [/h2]
- A bug currently exists where bows may randomly disappear.

[h2]Plans for Next Update:[/h2]
- Either continue  creating hardmode weapons or start porting to 1.4.4.
- More exclusive abilities for other weapons.

[h2] Future Plans [/h2]
1. More weapons.
2. Potentially other types of weapons (magic).
3. More unique abilities.


[h3] Important: Feedback will be greatly appreciated, but please be nice :3 [/h3]
Please kindly report any bugs as well!
