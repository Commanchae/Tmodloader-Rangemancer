[h2] Description [/h2]

Summon an arsenal of ranged weapons!
Have you ever thought about how awesome it would be if you could summon your beloved bows or guns as minions? Or ever struggled to decide between going for a Ranged or a Summoner class...or both?

This is all possible with Rangemancer.

With Rangemancer, you have the ability to convert certain ranged weapons to their summoning counterpart, allowing you to summon them to fight alongside you.

[h2] Main features [/h2]
1. You can convert certain bows and guns to their summoning counterparts.
2. The weapons will consume the ammo in your inventory. (Bows that have special effects from using wooden arrows will retain their effects (some effects may not work correctly for now))
3. Holding the respective summon item will allow that ranged weapon to use its special ability after a specific number of shots.

There are currently 13 weapons (pre-hardmode) available:

[h3] Bows [/h3]
1. Wooden Bow Summon (1 x Wooden Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
2. Gold Bow Summon (1 x Gold Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
3. Tendon Bow Summon (1 x Tendon Bow / Demon Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
4. The Bee's Knees Summon (1 x The Bee's Knees + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
5. Molten Fury Summon (1 x Molten Fury + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
6. Boreal Bow Summon (1 x Boreal Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
7. Demon Bow Summon (1 x Demon Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
8. Platinum Bow Summon (1 x Platinum Bow + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)

[h3] Guns [/h3]
1. Flintlock Pistol Summon (1 x Flintlock Pistol + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) 
2. Minishark Summon (1 x Minishark + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) 
3. Musket Summon (1 x Musket + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) 
4. Boomstick Summon (1 x Boomstick + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench)
 
 [h3] Miscellaneous [/h3]
 1. Grenade Summon (1 x Grenade + 3 x Fallen Star @ Workbench) (Recipe may be changed to be more expensive.)
(Currently consumes bullets)

[h2] Notes [/h2]
1. This mod is a simply a passion project. I'll only work on it when I can.
2. The aiming is a bit off at certain ranges for bows.
3. I have not tested this with other mods, therefore I won't be able to guarantee mod compatibility.
4. A bug currently exists where bows may randomly disappear.
5. The ammo only interacts correctly with the Endless Quiver/MusketPouch and not accessories like Magic Quiver, etc.
7. Guns and bows don't seem to aim too well for targets directly above or below.

[h2]Plans for Next Update:[/h2]
[h3] Please suggest any weapon you'd like to see in the comments [/h3]
Summons to Add:
- Snowball Cannon Summon
- Blowpipe Summon
- Undertaker Summon

[h2] Future Plans [/h2]
1. More weapons.
2. Potentially other types of weapons (magic).
3. More unique abilities.


[h3] Important: Feedback will be greatly appreciated, but please be nice :3 [/h3]
